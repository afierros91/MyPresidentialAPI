# Presidential API

## About
* Presidential API provides data on the Presidents of the USA. Data can be filtered through by search parameters such as party, number of terms, etc. or by individual President on the client side.  

## My Developer Role
* Set up server using NodeJS and Mongo by doing the following:
* 1. Setting up controllers for different HTTP requests.
* 2. Establishing routes for their respective HTTP requests. 
* 3. Creating a database or presidential information. 
* Set up client side in React by adding the following features:
* 1. A Home page with a search bar that performs and API call for individual Presidents. 
* 2. A search page that uses HTTP requests to filter through all presidential data and returns the relevant Presidents. 

## Technologies Used
